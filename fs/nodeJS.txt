Node.js is written in C++
At the heart of Node.js is the V8 engine
The v8 engine converts our JS into machine code 

Client and Server
-----------------------

PROTOCOLS -- a set of communication rules that ewo sides ageree to use  when communicating
SOCKET -- a channel between client and server where the data is  shared

BUFFERS
--------------
1 - temporary storage spot for a chunk of data that is being transferred from one place to another
2 - the buffer is filled with data then passed along
3 - transfers small amount of data at a time

STREAMS
--------------
flow of data that is transferred along the way
1 - WRITABLE STREAMS  --- allow Node.js to write data in stream
2 - READABLE STREAMS  --- allow Node.js to read data from stream
3 - DUPLEX   --- preforms both of the above operations

PIPES
------------
takes data from readstream and sends data to writestream


--------------->>> NPM <<<-----------------------
NPM ---------- NODE PACKAGE MANAGER
1 - To install NPM packages we use the command 
        --npm install package_name
2 -  To create our own JSON package 
        --npm init
            it asks some details about our package or project
3 - To add any NPM packages to our project or as dependencies of our project
        --npm install package_name -save
            this command updates our JSON file with the packages
4 - let some person uses our package(project) they don't know what packages we install so 
    we add dependencies to our JSON and to install all of them at onece we use
        --npm install

------------ NODEMON --------------
 NODEMON is the best package helps to restart the program 
 automatically whenever there is a change in the program
 instead we kill the process and run it again

 to install  NODEMON
 --npm install -g nodemon    (-g indicates this package install globally)

 to use nodemon
 --nodemon file_name


 ------- EXPRESS NPM -------------
1 - easy and flexible routing system
2 - integrates with many templates engines
3 - contains a middleware framework
 
                ------------ HTTP requests -------------
                1 - GET -  to get a request from server tpye url 
                2 - PUT -  post data or fill a form
                3 - DELETE  -  deleting data 
                4 - PUT  -  puting(updating some value)
 responding to these requests through EXPRESS

  - GET  -> var.get('route',fn)
  - PUT  -> var.put('route',fn)
  - DELETE -> var.delete('route',fn)
